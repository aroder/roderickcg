        Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</h2>
    <p>
        Web services allow faster application development, which means more bang for your
        buck, as well as being able to use the technology sooner. Integrating third-party
        web services into your web site or application results in excellent features at
        little cost.</p>
    <p>
        Service-Oriented Architecture is a combination of many technologies and can include
        web services. More importantly, it is a change of perspective from traditional software
        development. And most importantly, correctly implementing an SOA environment requires
        an understanding of the current IT infrastructure and best practices regarding SOA.
