        Business Process Management (BPM)</h2>
    <p>
        BPM is about efficiency and effectiveness of business processes. BPM projects consist
        of defining, measuring, and modifying a process--and then measuring the modified
        process to determine the impact of the change to the process. By following a structured
        approach, businesses can ensure that changes made to a current process will increase
        efficiency, reduce costs, increase accuracy, or any number of measures deemed as
        goals of the process.</p>
    <h2>

            <li>You have processes in place that began as ad hoc actions, but have solidified themselves</li>
            <li>The phrase "That's just how we've always done it" is heard in your organization</li>
            <li>You are entering a new market, opening a new line of business, or introducing a new product or service</li>
            <li>You want to ensure your processes match the needs of your organization</li>
